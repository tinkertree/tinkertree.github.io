Welcome to TinkerTree, where our family's curiosity branches out into the realms of nature, science, and technology. 

In this bumpy little adventure, we:

* Explore the intricate details of the world around us
* Learn by digging into challenging, hands-on projects
* Share our findings, hoping to spark curiosity in others

Far from experts, we are a family driven by a desire to learn and share our discoveries.

Happy exploring,

The Poznanovic Family
