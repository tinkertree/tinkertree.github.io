We had a friend over today, and our goal was to check out a local pond to see what was living there.

It turns out that winter time is somewhat tricky to find active life in pond water, but we still had a ton of fun. We were able to spot some movement under the microscope; however, we're still learning about microscopic life, so we haven't made any IDs yet.

One of the more surprisingly interesting finds was the stem of a cattail. The structure was quite intricate.

As the season warms up, we plan to repeatedly take pond samples and watch for an explosion in life!
