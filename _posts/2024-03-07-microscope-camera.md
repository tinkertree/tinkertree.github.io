Today, we dove into the realm of 3D printing!

Our end goal here was to hook up our camera to the microscope. The benefits are clear:
* watch in real-time on the nearby monitor (big hit with family and visitors)
* take pictures and videos

To do this, we 3D printed an adapter!

Recall from the previous post that our microscope is the Swift SW380T Compound Microscope. Since it is a trinocular, we are able to connect a camera.

We had an existing digital camera: an Olympus TG-6. This small camera has the capability for replacing lenses, and this actually came in handy with the adapter. 

How'd we get the adapter? Open source 3D printing design to the rescue! Details on the open source 3D design are here:

Check out the photos below of our new microscope+camera setup. It is a ton of fun!
